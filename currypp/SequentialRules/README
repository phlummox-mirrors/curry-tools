Sequential Rules Preprocessor
=============================

This directory contains the implementation of a preprocessor
for Curry programs in order to implement a sequential rule
ordering. The preprocessor transforms a Curry program
such that the transformed program implements a sequential
rule ordering.

The ideas of this transformation are described in the
[WFLP 2014 paper](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1335/wflp2014_paper5.pdf).

The preprocessor can be called with the following parameters:

... <input> : translate <input> program and show translated program

... <input> <output> : translate <input> program into <output> program

... <org> <infile> <outfile> : "preprocessor mode", i.e., translate
  <infile> to <outfile> where <org> is the original program
