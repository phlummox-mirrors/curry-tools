Default Rules Preprocessor
==========================

This directory contains the implementation of a preprocessor
for Curry programs in order to implement default rules.
A default rule for a function `f` processed by this preprocessor
must be defined as a rule defining `default_f` (see the examples
in the directory Examples).

The preprocessor can be called with the following parameters:

... <input> : translate <input> program and show translated program

... -r <input> : translate <input> program and load the translated program
                 into the Curry system

... <org> <infile> <outfile> : "preprocessor mode", i.e., translate
  <infile> to <outfile> where <org> is the original program
